# RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation

This project aims to assist the Marketing department of SuperStore, a global retail company, in segmenting their customer base using the RFM (Recency – Frequency – Monetary) model. With a vast dataset, manual segmentation isn't viable, necessitating Python for automated segmentation. The tasks involve dataset preparation, RFM scoring, customer grouping, visualization, analysis, and recommendations for Marketing.

## Tasks:

1. **Data Preparation:** Prepare a suitable dataset for the RFM model.
2. **RFM Calculation:** Define the calculation method and calculate the R, F, M scores for each customer. Note: R index calculation considers the date as of December 31, 2011.
3. **Scoring System:** Establish a scoring system ranging from 1 to 5.
4. **Customer Grouping:** Group customers based on the classification table.
5. **Visualization:** Visualize the quantity of each segment using various data dimensions.
6. **Analysis:** Analyze the current status of the company and provide recommendations for the Marketing team.
7. **Prioritization:** Suggest which of the three R, F, M indices should be prioritized for the retail model of SuperStore.
